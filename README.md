# RTB code test

*Description: build a simple webapp using Node.JS, Express and a UI framework of your choice (Angular, React, Vue etc). End result: a WebApp that at least brings all data from the persistence layer as a table and the user can filter the seller or the country they want to see, something like the mockup below. Note that you are free to create any template you want and add any extra feature that you see fit*

## Getting Started

- Requirements: node (used version: 12.17.0) installed and npm or yarn installed;
- Then run: `yarn` or `npm install` to fetch the dependencies both inside backend and frontend directory;
- After, for the backend in development run: `yarn dev`;
- For frontend in development run: `yarn start`;

**Obs.: For the backend to work with the firebase database is needed an serviceAccountKey. There's an example inside config's folder.**
